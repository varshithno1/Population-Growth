                <h2>Population Growth</h2>

                        <h4>Fertility rates</h4>
                        <p>High fertility rates can result in rapid population growth, as more children are born than people die.</p>

                        <h4>Immigration</h4>
                        <p>Immigration can increase the population of a country, as more people move into the country than leave it.</p>

                        <h4>Urbanization</h4>
                        <p>As more people move into cities, urbanization occurs, resulting in the growth of urban areas and the development of urban infrastructure. This can lead to increased economic growth, but it can also cause environmental problems such as pollution, traffic congestion, and a strain on resources.</p>

                        <h4>Environmental issues</h4>
                        <p>Population growth can have a significant impact on the environment, as more people consume more resources and generate more waste. This can lead to deforestation, soil degradation, and the depletion of natural resources, among other environmental issues.</p>

                        <h4>Pressure on infrastructure</h4>
                        <p>As the population grows, there is increased pressure on infrastructure such as housing, transportation, and utilities. This can lead to a shortage of affordable housing, overcrowding, and a strain on public services.</p>

                        <p>Population growth can also lead to increased economic growth, as there are more people to contribute to the workforce and the economy. However, this growth must be managed carefully to ensure that it is sustainable and equitable.</p>
