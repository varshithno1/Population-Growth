                    <p>Population growth can put a strain on natural resources in several ways.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>First, as the population grows, so does the demand for food, water, and energy. This can lead to overuse and depletion of these resources, potentially leading to shortages and increased competition for access to them.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Second, population growth can lead to increased pollution and environmental degradation. As more individuals use resources and generate waste, this can lead to increased levels of air and water pollution, deforestation, and other forms of environmental damage. This can have negative impacts on human health, as well as on the health of ecosystems and the biodiversity they support.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Third, population growth can put a strain on infrastructure, particularly in urban areas. As more individuals move into cities, this can lead to increased demands on transportation systems, housing, and other amenities. This can lead to congestion, overcrowding, and other challenges that can negatively impact quality of life.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fourth, population growth can lead to increased competition for natural resources, particularly in areas with limited resources or areas that are already facing environmental challenges such as drought or desertification. This can create conflicts between different groups or regions, potentially leading to social and political instability.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Overall, population growth can put a strain on resources and the environment, leading to negative impacts on human health and well-being, as well as on the health of ecosystems and biodiversity. To manage these challenges, it is important to adopt sustainable practices that minimize resource use and waste, promote conservation and biodiversity protection, and ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to live a healthy and fulfilling life.</p>
