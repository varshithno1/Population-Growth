                    <p>Population growth can put pressure on infrastructure in several ways.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>First, as the population grows, so does the demand for transportation infrastructure such as roads, highways, and public transportation. This can lead to increased congestion and longer commute times, as well as increased wear and tear on roads and other infrastructure.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Second, population growth can put pressure on housing and other built infrastructure such as water and sanitation systems. This can lead to overcrowding, insufficient access to affordable housing, and other challenges that can negatively impact quality of life.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Third, population growth can put pressure on social infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and other public services. As more individuals require access to these services, it can be challenging for governments and other organizations to meet the growing demand, potentially leading to longer wait times and reduced quality of care.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fourth, population growth can put pressure on natural infrastructure such as water and air quality, as more individuals use resources and generate waste. This can lead to increased pollution and other environmental impacts that can negatively impact human health and well-being.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Overall, population growth can put significant pressure on infrastructure, leading to challenges such as congestion, overcrowding, and reduced access to essential services. To manage these challenges, it is important to invest in sustainable infrastructure that can meet the needs of a growing population without compromising the health of people and the environment. This may involve investments in public transportation, affordable housing, and other essential services, as well as efforts to promote conservation and sustainable resource use.</p>
